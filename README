=============
Nautilus Wipe
=============

Overview
========

Nautilus Wipe allows you to wipe files or available disk space from within
Nautilus.

Dependencies
============

- libnautilus-extension 2.x or 3.x (http://live.gnome.org/Nautilus)
- GTK2 >= 2.6 or GTK3 (http://www.gtk.org)
- libgsecuredelete (http://wipetools.tuxfamily.org/libgsecuredelete.html)
- GConf 2.x (http://projects.gnome.org/gconf/) -- only needed for Nautilus 2.x

Build dependencies
==================

- make
- gcc
- intltool
- yelp-tools

If you are building from Git rather than a tarball, you also need
`autoconf`, `automake` (>= 1.11.1) and `libtool` (>= 2.2).

Quick installation instructions
===============================

::

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  # make install

If you have both GTK2 and GTK3 development files installed and want to
build against GTK2, you should pass the ``--without-gtk3`` flag to
``./configure``.

If you are building from Git, you first need to run ``./autogen.sh``,
which will prepare the build system and generate the `configure` script.

Support for Caja and Nemo
-------------------------

Caja and Nemo are supported through the ``--with-nautilus=caja`` and
``--with-nautilus=nemo`` flags.  The support is however currently
experimental.
