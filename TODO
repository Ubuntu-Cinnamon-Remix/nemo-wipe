* Adapt the default wipe algorithm and the manual to the latest papers
  suggestions (a few random passes are enought on modern hard drives).
  cf. http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html and
  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-88/NISTSP800-88_rev1.pdf
  This is partially done by commits 787a5d6..7677362, but proposing more random
  passes would be nice. However, this would require to use an other backend,
  e.g. scrub (cf. http://code.google.com/p/diskscrub/) instead of secure-delete.

* Perhaps cleanup a bit progress dialog, it is currently overkill

* Add our entries in the same section on the context's menu that
  the "Delete" and the "Move to trash" entry
  -> I don't think it's possible

* When one try to remove a single file on a flash device, explain that it's not
  useful at all rather than doing it, giving the user a false impression of
  security.

* Handle the trash
  * the trash itself (trash:///) could be done by "simply" finding out the
    various trash locations.  Easier said than done, but doable.
  * Individual items in it (e.g. trash:///foo.txt).  that's even harder,
    because Nemo doesn't seem able to give a local path for those.
    The best I can think of right now is try and find an item in one of the
    trash locations (as in first point above) that matches (e.g. in case of
    trash:///foo.txt, find /foo.txt in any of the trash locations).  It's not
    awesome, and it gets especially tricky if 2 files with the same path are
    trashed in different trash folders (which one to choose?).  Maybe GIO's
    G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TRASH_ORIG_PATH can help, as we should then be able to
    locate the appropriate trash.
  * maybe cleanup the .trashinfo in the info/ part of the trash?
